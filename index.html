        I love you a lot.<br>
        I'm really happy that we're getting better and better at being a couple together. I hope that we can continue to grow to become better individually and symbiotically.
        I know sometimes it can get tiring having to keep talking through different problems and it getting heated a bit at times, but I really, truly, do think that it's for the best in our relationship and that it'll pay dividends in the long run.
        I'll throw shade at Wilson and Jenna and say that I don't want to become an old Asian couple that isn't able to communicate with each other, causing needless but constant tension between them.
        You bring me a lot of happiness, so that's why I get adamant sometimes about learning what I can do better when I see you get sad. I want you to be able to experience the same happiness that you give me.
        Thanks for also introducing me to your friend group. I might not have a lot of common interests with them but I think they're a good group of people, and I enjoy spending time with you and them ‚Äî especially if it makes you happy :)
        I'm excited to play more badminton with you, watch more shows, exercise in the mornings, go to tournaments, try different foods, RAHH everything :3. Even the little things like scrolling through TikTok and getting head rubs, those moments make me happy. Also let me give you more massages.
        Here's to another year of being happy together!
        <br>
        From Pookie,
        Michael Ewy <3
